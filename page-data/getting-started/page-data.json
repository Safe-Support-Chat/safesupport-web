There is an extra step to logging in through the Riot app, however.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/riot-login.jpg\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Mobile app login screen\" />\n</p>\n<p>When you get to the login screen, check the box for <strong>Use custom server options (advanced)</strong> and enter the URL for your centre's Matrix server. You can get this from you program administrator.</p>\n<p>The layout of the Riot app will look slightly different from your centre's messaging platform, but it has all the same functionality. Don't forget to log out at the end of your shift!</p>\n<h2>Logging in to your account</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/login-screen.jpg\" alt=\"Login page\"></p>\n<p>You need a username and password to log into the messaging platform. Talk to your program administrator to find out what login credentials you should be using.</p>\n<h2>Facilitators Community</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/community-page.jpg\" alt=\"Facilitators Community page\"></p>\n<p>In order to receive support requests, you need to be part of the Facilitators Community. If you're not already a member, ask your program administrator to add you. The community page is also a resource for you, it is where you can find information, links and resources from your centre. To see your community page, click on the icon on the far left panel of the page. To leave the community page, click on any of your chat rooms to go back to the chat.</p>\n<h2>Help Bot</h2>\n<p>There is a very helpful chatbot living on your messaging platform! It receives support requests from your centre's website and sends the chat invitations to the facilitators, such as yourself. Do not remove the bot from any of your chatrooms.</p>\n<p>Bot commands start with <code>!bot</code> and then then the command. Right now the only command the bot responds to is <code>!bot transcript</code> which will send you a transcript of the chat if your centre has this option configured. If you want to be polite, you can also say <code>!bot transcript please</code>.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/getting-started","title":"Getting Started"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
