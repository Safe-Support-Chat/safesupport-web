It looks like this:</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/master/docs/invitation.png\" width=\"250\" alt=\"Chat invitation\" />\n</p>\n<p>To accept a support request, click on the invitation and then click <strong>Accept</strong>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/master/docs/accept-invitation.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Accept invitation screen\" />\n</p>\n<p>The chat invitation will go out to all of the facilitators who are currently online. Once one facilitator accepts the chat invitation, the other invitations will be revoked. So if you ever get an invitation notification but then when you open the app it disappears, it's because another facilitator beat you to it.</p>\n<p>All of the support requests and accepted invitations are also recorded in the <strong>Support Chat Notifications</strong> chatroom, so you can see who is responding to each request. If you don't want to receive the notifications in this room, you can do that by clicking on the menu icon for the chatroom and setting notifications to <strong>Mute</strong>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/master/docs/mute-message.png\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Mute messages\" />\n</p>\n<h2>Chat Features</h2>\n<h3>Encryption</h3>\n<p>End to end encryption means that all of the messages sent in your chat conversation are encrypted (scrambled) before they are sent over the internet, then decrypted (unscrambled) when they reach the other end. So if there is anyone spying on your internet traffic, they won't be able to see what the messages are. Here's the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\">wikipedia page</a> if you want more information.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/blob/master/docs/confirm.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Warning message on encrypted messages\"></p>\n<p>When you start a new chat, the first time you send a message a warning will pop up that says \"Please confirm that you want to send messages to an unknown recipient\". This comes up because you are starting an encrypted chat with an unknown device. Click \"Continue\" to send your message and continue the conversation.</p>\n<h3>Emojis</h3>\n<p>There's a keyboard shortcut for accessing the emoji menu; type a colon <code>:</code> to open it. If you know the name of the emoji you want to use, you can just type it in with a colon before and after, like <code>:happy:</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/blob/master/docs/emoji-menu.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Emoji menu\"></p>\n<p>The alternative is to use your computer's emoji menu, which you can access in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Mac: <code>control</code> + <code>command</code> + <code>space</code></li>\n<li>On Windows: <code>Windows</code> + <code>;</code> or <code>Windows</code> + <code>.</code> to open the touch keyboard, then click the emoji icon</li>\n<li>On Chrome: Right click and select 'Emoji &#x26; Symbols' from the context menu</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rename the chatroom</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/blob/master/docs/room-name.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Rename chatroom\"></p>\n<p>Since the support seekers are anonymous, the help bot uses the time and date to name the chatroom when it's created. However you can rename the room to whatever you like to help you organize your conversations. To do that, click on the gear icon in the top right menu to open the room settings. There, you can save a new name for the room. <strong>Only you see the room name, not the support seeker</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Transfer the chat</h3>\n<p>If you need to transfer the chat to another facilitator, you can do that by inviting them to join the chatroom. Click on the person icon in the top right menu and then click on the \"Invite to this room\" button. Type in the name or username of the facilitator who you want to invite. They will need to accept the invitation from their account in order to join the room. Once they have joined, you should let the support seeker know you're transferring the chat, as they will not see any notifications about the new facilitator joining the room.</p>\n<h3>Ending the chat</h3>\n<p>You will get a status update in the chat room when the support seeker has left the chat. You can also leave the chatroom, by clicking on the menu icon for to the chatroom and then clicking \"Leave\".</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/master/docs/leave-room.png\" alt=\"Leave room\" width=\"500\" />\n</p>\n<p>After you leave the room, it will still appear in your \"Historical\" section, under the \"Rooms\" section. To delete the chat history, click on the menu icon for the room and click \"Forget\".</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/master/docs/forget-room.png\" alt=\"Forget room\" width=\"500\" />\n</p>\n<h3>Get the transcript</h3>\n<p>To get the transcript for a chat session, you can enter the command <code>!bot transcript</code> or <code>!bot transcript please</code> in the chatroom. The bot will then generate a text file with the chat transcript that you can download and save however you want. Only you see link to download the transcript file, not the support seeker.\n<img src=\"https://github.com/nomadic-labs/ocrcc-chatbox/blob/master/docs/transcript-download.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Bot command to download transcript\"></p>\n<p>Once you leave the chatroom or log out of the platform, you won't have access to the transcript anymore so make sure you get it right when the chat is over.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/using-the-support-chat","title":"Using the Support Chat"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
