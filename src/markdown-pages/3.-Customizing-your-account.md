In your account settings page, you can update your account information such as email address and password. You can also set your display name, which is the name that will appear to support seekers when you join the chat.

You may also want to update your notification preferences to suit your needs; you can select which types of notifications you want to receive and how you want to receive them (audible, desktop notifications, etc.)

There are also a number of display preferences you can change. The only one you should NOT change is "Enable Community Filter Panel", as that is what gives you access to the Facilitators Community.
