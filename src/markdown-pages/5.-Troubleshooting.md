If you are having issues with the messaging platform, there are a couple of things you can try:
1. Clear the cache and restart the application

2. If you have logged on from multiple devices, delete any previous sessions.

3. Make sure you are still a member of the Facilitators Community
4. Makes sure your notifications are not muted
5. Makes sure the Help Bot is not "ignored" (look in your account settings)
6. Try using a different browser (Chrome and Firefox are best)
