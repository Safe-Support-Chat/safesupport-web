You are visiting our Terms of Use Page for Safe Support Chat.

A Terms of Use page allows you to disclose information about your service and how you would like people to interact with it.
Some things to consider when creating a terms of use page:
- Use simple and easy-to-understand language
- Sharing confidentiality, privacy and security practices
- Let people know how you will handle harassing or prank chats
- Share whether you have a duty to report and if so, under what circumstances (eg. Someone discloses that they are under the age of 16 and they are experiencing physical, sexual or emotional abuse)
- Be clear about what information you gather and keep during a chat
